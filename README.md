# Puuuush

> A modern, minimalist tab manager for Chrome to organize your browser life.

Puuuush replaces your New Tab page with a clean, organized dashboard. Save your open tabs into groups, organize them by project or context, and restore them when you're ready to work. Similar to Toby, but open source and built with a modern stack.

## Features

- 🗂 **Group Tabs**: Save all tabs in your window to a named group.
- 📌 **Pin Groups**: Pin important groups to the top for easy access.
- ✏️ **Edit & Organize**: Rename groups (with auto-focus), collapse them, and drag-and-drop to reorder.
- 🔙 **Restore**: Open all tabs in a group with one click, or restore individual tabs.
- 🔄 **Sync**: Groups are synced across all your Chrome instances via Chrome Storage Sync.
- 🎨 **Modern UI**: Clean, Dark Mode design using shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS.
- 🤏 **Drag & Drop**: Reorder groups and tabs with intuitive drag-and-drop.
- ⚡️ **Lightweight**: Built with Vite and React for instant load times.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui (Radix UI), Lucide Icons
- **Logic**: Chrome Extension Manifest V3 (Service Worker)
- **DnD**: @dnd-kit (Sortable, Core, Utilities)
